The signiﬁcant contribution of our work is:• Development of a power-efﬁcient bot which is enabled by FPGA, a low-power embedded system which shows optimizationinbothpowerconsumptionandperformance in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) applications. • The biggest challenges for the cost-effective robotic-fruit pluckeraredetection,i.e.determiningthelocationofeach fruit and detaching them from the plant without harming the plant in the absence of costly sensors and processing unit. • We demonstrate a simple and effective vision-based algorithm for fruit, a 3D localization, and grasp selection method.
