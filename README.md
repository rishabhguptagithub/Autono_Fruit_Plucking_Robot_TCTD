# A Proposal of FPGA-based Low Cost and Power Efﬁcient Autonomous Fruit Harvester
 
## [Paper](http://patelmanthan.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ICCAR_2020.pdf) 

Our work is accepted in IEEE International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics 2020

The signiﬁcant contribution of our work is:
• Development of a power-efﬁcient bot which is enabled by FPGA, a low-power embedded system which shows optimizationinbothpowerconsumptionandperformance in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) applications.
• The biggest challenges for the cost-effective robotic-fruit pluckeraredetection,i.e.determiningthelocationofeach fruit and detaching them from the plant without harming the plant in the absence of costly sensors and processing unit.
• We demonstrate a simple and effective vision-based algorithm for fruit, a 3D localization, and grasp selection method.
